    <p><strong>Kinfolk Finders</strong> is a registered, full service, professional genealogy and historical research company. We are located at Parkhill, in southwestern Ontario, Canada, close to numerous primary source collections.</p>
    <p>Our searches can range from the retrieval of a single document to the writing of a complete family or corporate history. We search all available records and other documents to provide you with as detailed a history as you desire.</p>
    <p>While we continue to do Canadian, American, English and Scottish genealogy, we have turned our focus to Irish Research, indexing cemeteries there, and publishing those indexes along with other primary sources such as parish registers and Poor Law Union records from the famine period.</p>
