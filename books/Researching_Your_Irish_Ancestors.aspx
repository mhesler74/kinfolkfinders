        <p>This book will help all those, no matter where they live, who are searching for ancestors in Ireland. David R. Elliott has taken eleven research trips to Ireland on behalf of his clients and has worked in most archival repositories in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Dr. Elliott gives clues to finding your ancestral county, then the parish and townland within the county. He explains how Irish archival centres work and describes how you can flesh out your ancestors’ lives and what you might find in cemeteries.</p>
        <p>An experienced genealogist and seasoned traveller, he gives practical advice on preparing for your trip with tips on travel, driving, accommodation, and meals. Ireland’s unique history is outlined, as well as the impact that religion and politics have had on genealogical research. An annotated bibliography and a review of important websites round out this illustrated guide.</p>
